# Clean-Temp

"Clean Temp" is an application designed to help users efficiently clean up temporary files and folders from their computer. Temporary files are created by various applications and processes on a computer and are intended to be used for a short period of time. However, these files can accumulate over time, taking up valuable disk space and slowing down the computer's performance.

The "Clean Temp" application provides a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly scan their computer for temporary files and folders. Once the scan is complete, the application presents a list of all temporary files and folders found, along with their file size and location.

**There are a few versions of the application.**
